# Someone sabotaged this FortiGate! Multiple issues planted:
#
# 1. Wrong static route → points to 10.x.1.99 (doesn't exist)
# 2. DNS servers → 192.0.2.1 / 192.0.2.2 (RFC 5737 — unreachable)
# 3. NAT disabled on LAN-to-WAN policy
# 4. HTTPS removed from WAN interface allowaccess
# =============================================================================

# Issue 1: Bad default route

    next
end

# Issue 2: Broken DNS
